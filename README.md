# Java-Projects
These are some of the projects I've done with Java, and just an intro of them.

"Boxes" is a simple java code using Canvas, and showcasing how coding works with pixels. 
"Flappy Bird" is a rendition of the game flappy bird, which was the code itself was inspired by Stratofortress.
"Programming Project 2" and "Sports" are both examples of how we can re-use certain parts of code, through calling methods, and also inheritance.
